# Project predict customer of resturant 
- in japan
- all resturant which have online reservation service
- components of project github
  - [Code folder](https://github.com/leilanorouzi/SpringBoard/tree/master/Capstone_project1/Codes): contains codes of data processing, data visulaziation and forcasting models.
  - [Files folder](https://github.com/leilanorouzi/SpringBoard/tree/master/Capstone_project1/Files): This folder contains [input files](https://github.com/leilanorouzi/SpringBoard/tree/master/Capstone_project1/Files/Inputs) and  [output files](https://github.com/leilanorouzi/SpringBoard/tree/master/Capstone_project1/Files/Outputs). This folder includes graphes, pictures and histograms of two models.

## Summary of project
### The problem
- what we have 
- what is the question
## Data
### What are data?
They were downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting/data.

## Data wrangling
- size of files
- extracing data instead of dealing with categorical data
- generating more features
### Merging data
- air data and hpg data using air and hpg store_id_relation
### Extacting more data
- year
- month
- day
### missing data
- in hpg data
## Data processing
### Visulazation the data
- link to graphs : https://github.com/leilanorouzi/SpringBoard/tree/master/Capstone_project1/Files/Outputs/Graphes
### Categorical data
- changing categorical data to numerical data
- why numerical data
#### resturant locations on the map
- using google map
#### histograms
- daily
- weakly
- monthly
- holiday
- area
- genre
- stores
## Prediction model
- why we have two models
### Porphet model
- link to the code: 
- gives general tred of all reservation over the time in all resturant
- Seasonal, monthly, weekly, daily variation
### Calssification model
- link to the code: 
- Random forest model
- why random forest
## Results
### Error and accuracy
## Recommendations
### Weather data
### generating data
